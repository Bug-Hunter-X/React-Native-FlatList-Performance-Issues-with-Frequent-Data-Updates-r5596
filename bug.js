This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and the data source changes frequently.  The issue stems from the fact that FlatList often re-renders its items excessively, leading to performance issues and sometimes unexpected behavior.  This is exacerbated when using complex data structures or when data changes are not properly managed.  For example, consider a scenario where the data source is updated frequently, causing FlatList to re-render all items even if only a few items have actually changed.  This can lead to poor performance, especially with large datasets.

```javascript
// Example of problematic code
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.value}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
/>
```
